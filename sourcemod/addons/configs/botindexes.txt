//IMPORTANT
// - Bot Indexes must start from 1
// - Bot Indexes must be continuous, skipping indexes will NOT work
// - The first 56 bot indexes will be selected randomly if tf_bot_allow_join is set to 1
// 		- Any index at any time can be spawned with the command: sm_spawnbot [index]
// - Bots must have weapons properly setup
